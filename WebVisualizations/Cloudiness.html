    <p>
        What's most interesting about the Cloudiness data, is that there appears to be little to no cloudiness within the month of January when closer to the equator. 
        We do see a a variety of percentages throughout this plot, but many are within the 0 percentil. 
        However, there does appear to be a greater volume around 40 to 80 Latitude than -40 to -60
